## v0.5 — Polish (partially done)
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Dark mode
- [ ] Unit preferences (metric/imperial)
- [ ] Help/intro tour
- [ ] Web workers for performance
- [x] Project save/load/export (IndexedDB + JSON)
- [ ] Print views

## v1.0 — Production
- [ ] 3D cabinet visualization (Three.js)
- [ ] STL export
- [ ] Graph digitizer UI
- [ ] Waveguide designer
- [ ] DSP biquad export
- [ ] REW measurement import
- [ ] Full test coverage
- [ ] Docker image published
- [x] GitHub Pages live

## Driver Database Expansion

Current: 34 drivers with real measured data. Prioritized sources:
1. loudspeakerlab.com Plotly JSON exports (preferred — real measured curves)
2. Manufacturer PDFs (digitized via pixel extraction)
3. loudspeakerdatabase.com (rate-limited, fallback only)

Candidates for future addition: More SB Acoustics wooferes, SEAS Prestige
series, Dayton RS series extensions, Purifi midrange, Morel tweeteres.
