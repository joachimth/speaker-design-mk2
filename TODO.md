- [x] Memoize driver database queries (driverMap via useMemo, all find() calls replaced with Map.get/has)

### Bug fixes (Sep 1)
- [x] Fix STL downloadSTL href bug (a.href was set to filename instead of blob URL)
- [x] Fix degenerate quad in addHollowBox front wall (v1==v2 duplicate vertex)

### Code quality
- [x] Add React ErrorBoundary (ErrorBoundary.tsx wraps all routes)
- [x] Replace 25 `any` types with proper types (pdf/extractor.ts, driverStore/projectStore catch blocks, simulationWorker casts, database.ts, GraphDigitizer, DriverManager)
- [x] Fix database.ts mixed static+dynamic import warning (projectStore + SystemSimulation now use static imports)
- [x] Add aria-labels for accessibility (added to unit toggle, cabinet type selectors, ways selector, subwoofer remove, parameter set selector)

### Features to consider

- [x] Target curve optimizer UI with smooth/flat/Harman/tilted selector + plot comparison

### Sep 3 review & cleanup
- [x] Fix 3-way Cabinet Match handoff: when no midrange found, fallback to 2-way with correct ways count
- [x] Fix A/B Sammenligning: load projects on mount (was empty unless Overblik visited first)
- [x] Add CrossoverSlider to SystemSimulation (was only in CrossoverDesigner)
- [x] Multi-resolution target curve optimizer (1.0 → 0.5 → 0.25 → 0.1 dB steps, ~4x faster + more precise)
- [x] Real-time deviation meter (RMS error vs target curve, color-coded progress bar)
- [x] Guided workflow: "Næste" navigation buttons on each design tab (NextStep component)
- [x] Rename "Simulering" tab to "Directivity" to avoid confusion with "System Sim."
- [x] Remove duplicate ResponsivePlot components (shared component used everywhere, ~155 lines removed)
- [x] Remove duplicate useEffect in SystemSimulation (auto-select drivers was defined twice)
- [x] Remove dead loadedDesign state from projectStore (defined but never consumed)
- [x] Fix unused catch variable in projectStore
- [x] Improve overview workflow guide with clickable navigation to each step
